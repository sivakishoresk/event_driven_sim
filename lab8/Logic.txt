Sir Tommorow I am having 2 exams so I couldn't complete the code but I will try to xplain the logic 
We will create two heaps with size and trigger time as priority lets say size_heap and time_heap
And to impliment this firstly after firing the one with less size , i.e, by del_min() in the size_heap
we will get the time rquired for that to transfer and now by using min() operation in the heap B we will get the node with least trigger time 
and if both the nodes are same then there is only one package in air so this task can be completed
And if they are not same then we will be traversing along the heap like a traversal we have done in binary trees and 
we we will delete all the nodes which have trigger time less than trigger_time + size/1000 of the min element in the time_heap.
